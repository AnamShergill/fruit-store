        <h1 style="padding-top: 20px;">About Fruits</h1>
   <p style="font-size: large;">
    Fruit has been recognized as a good source of vitamins and minerals, and for their role in preventing vitamin C and vitamin A deficiencies. 
    People who eat fruit as part of an overall healthy diet generally have a reduced risk of chronic diseases. USDA's MyPlate encourages 
    making half your plate fruits and vegetables for healthy eating.
   </p>
    
   <p style="font-size: large;">
    Fruits are important sources of many nutrients, including potassium, fiber, vitamin C, and folate (folic acid). 
    Try incorporating blueberries, citrus fruits, cranberries, or strawberries, which contain phytochemicals that are being studied for added health benefits.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: large;">
    The nutrients in fruit are vital for health and maintenance of your body. The potassium in fruit can reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. 
    Potassium may also reduce the risk of developing kidney stones and help to decrease bone loss as you age.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: large;">
    Folate (folic acid) helps the body form red blood cells. Women of childbearing age who may become pregnant and those in the first trimester of pregnancy need adequate folate. 
    Folate helps prevent neural tube birth defects, such as spina bifida.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: large;">
    They are one of the most popular fruits on the market today, so much so that Australians import a large amount of fresh and frozen berries each year.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: large;">
    The recent health issues associated with imported frozen berries have stopped many people from eating these lovely fruits.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: large;">
    Blueberries, Raspberries, Mulberries, Strawberries, and Grapes all grow well locally. It is all about selection, planting, and location. 
    Some blueberries worth trying are the low chill types. Common ones available locally include 
    <strong>‘Gulf Coast’, ‘Biloxi’, ‘Sharpblue’, ‘Misty’, ‘Britwell’, ‘Legacy’,</strong> and <strong>‘Powderblue’</strong>. 
    For exotic Raspberries, try the autumn fruiting types such as <strong>‘Heritage’</strong> and <strong>‘Autumn Blizz’</strong>.
